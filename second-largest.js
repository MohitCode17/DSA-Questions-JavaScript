/*
👉 Second Largest

Given an array arr, return the second largest distinct element from an array. If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.

Examples:

Input: arr = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.
Input: arr = [10, 10]
Output: -1
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element does not exist so answer is -1.

const secondLargest = function (arr) {
  if (arr.length < 2) return -1;

  let first = -Infinity;
  let second = -Infinity;

  for (let num of arr) {
    if (num > first) {
      second = first;
      first = num;
    } else if (num > second && num < first) {
      second = num;
    }
  }
  return second === -Infinity ? -1 : second;
};

console.log(secondLargest([12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]));
console.log(secondLargest([10, 10]));
